#
#    Temperature Monitoring (Basic solution) -- This digital solution enables, measures,
#    reports and records different  types of temperatures (contact, air, radiated)
#    so that the temperature conditions surrounding a process can be understood and 
#    taken action upon. Supported sensors include 
#    k-type thermocouples, RTDs, air samplers, and NIR-based sensors.
#    The solution provides a Grafana dashboard that 
#    displays the temperature timeseries, set threshold value, and a state timeline showing 
#    the change in temperature. An InfluxDB database is used to store timestamp, temperature, 
#    threshold and status.
