# This file defines the questions that will be asked to generate a user configuration file.
# Each question has a unique key, a type, and other parameters depending on the type.
# The criteria field is used to determine when a question should be asked, based on previous answers.
# Criteria can use 'and' (&) and 'or' (|) operators, and parentheses for grouping.
# for example: criteria = "a=1 & (b=2 | b=3)" means the question 
# will be asked if the 'a' is '1' and the 'b' is either '2' or '3'.

# The value of a question can be referenced in the user configuration template using {{<key>}}.
# The following question types are supported:
# - text: free text input from the user
#     [Q.<key>]
#       type = "text"
#       criteria = "<criteria>"
#       prompt = "<prompt>"         # what the user is asked
# - select: user selects from a list of options
#     [Q.<key>]
#       type = "select"
#       criteria = "<criteria>"
#       prompt = "<prompt>"         # what the user is asked
#       # each option is defined as:
#       opt.<value> = "<option_text>" 
#       opt.<next_value> = "<next_option_text>"

# Note: The following lines are examples of how to reference the answers in the user configuration template.
# For example, in user_config.toml, you can use {{machine_name}} to insert the machine name provided by the user.
# module_config_file = "./module_config/{{module_config_file}}.toml"
# calculation.machine_name.config.machine = "{{machine_name}}"
# calculation.current_clamp.config.nominal_current = {{clamp_rating}}
